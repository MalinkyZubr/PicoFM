### 1.6
#### 13 Verify the program:
```
{x != y}
    if x <= y {
        min = x
    }
    else {
        min = y
    }
{R(x,y)}
```

* postcondition should be: [(x < y and min = x) V (x > y and min = y)]
* test the first branch (conditional rule)

```
{x != y ^ x <= y}       x < y: modified precondition
    min = x             x = x: TRUE, assignment rule
{min = x ^ x < y}       both postcondition is true, thus the program is valid for first branch
```

* test the second branch (conditional rule)

```
{x != y ^ x > y}       x > y: precondition
    min = y             y = y: TRUE, assignment rule
{min = y ^ x > y}       both postcondition is true, thus the
```

* All branches are true, thus the program is valid

#### 14 Verify the program
```
(x != 0)
    if x >= 0 {
        abs = x
    }
    else {
        abs = -x
    }
{R(x,y)}
```

* postcondition R(x,y) should be equal to : {abs = $|x|$ = $\sqrt{x^2}$}
* test the first branch (conditional rule)

// not in nice format because markdown doesnt like

(x != 0 ^ x >= 0)

abs = x, $\sqrt{x^2}$ = x, $x^2=x^2$ true for all positive numbers (assignment rule)

{abs = $|x|$ = $\sqrt{x^2}$}


* check the second branch

(x != 0 ^ x >= 0)

abs = -x, $\sqrt{x^2}$ = -x, $x^2=x^2$ true for all negative numbers (assignment rule)

{abs = $|x|$ = $\sqrt{x^2}$}

* because the program is proven for all branches, the program is valid

### 2.3
#### 3

```
i = 1
j = x

while i != y {
    j = j * x
    i = i + 1
}
```

* find $x^y$
* loop invariant: $j = x^i$
  * base case: $j = x^1$
  * inductive hypothesis: $j_i = x^i$
  * inductive step: $j_{i + 1} = x^{i + 1}$
    * $j_{i + 1} = x * x^i$
    * $j_{i + 1} = x * j_i$
    * thus by first principle of mathematical induction the loop invariant holds
  * end condition: $j_y = x^i$, match desired function return $x^y$
  * Q ^ !B, !B == (i = y), Q == $j_n = x^i$, thus Q ^ !B is true
* The loop statement is true

#### 12
* prove the program's validity

```
i = 1
i = 2

while i != n {
    j = j * 2
    i = i + 1
}
```

* $2^n$ for $n >= 1$
* invariant: $j = 2^i$
* prove invariant:
  * base case: $j_1 = 2^1$ -> true
  * inductive hypothesis: $j_i = 2^i$
  * inductive step: $j_{i + 1} = 2^{i + 1}$
    * $j_{i + 1} = 2 * 2^{i}$
    * $j_{i + 1} = 2j_i$
    * thus by first principle of induction the invariant is true
  * at termination: $j_n = 2^n$
* B! == (i != n)
  * true at loop termination
* Q ^ !B -> true, thus the loop is valid

#### Question 1
* use loop invariant to prove that the program for computing nth power, where n is positive of number x is correct

```
power = 1
i = 1
 
while i <= n {
    power = power * x
    i = i + 1
}
```

* loop invariant: $power = x^i$
* inductive proof:
  * base case: $power_1 = x^1$ True
  * inductive hypothesis $power_i = x^i$
  * inductive step $power_{i + 1} = x^{i + 1}$
    * $power_{i + 1} = x * x^i$
    * $power_{i + 1} = x * power_i$
    * thus invariant is true by first principle of mathematical induction
  * at the termination: $power = x^n$ -> matches desired expression
* B! = i > n
* at termination: Q ^ B! is true, thus the loop is correct
